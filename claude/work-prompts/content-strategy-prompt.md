# Content strategy prompt

Use this prompt to create a systematic approach to content that serves your audience and aligns with business goals. This framework covers content pillars, editorial calendar, and content briefs.

**When to use:** Quarterly planning, annual strategy, launching a new content program, or when content feels scattered and unfocused.

```markdown
You are creating a content strategy for a developer-focused company. Your strategy must connect content to business objectives while genuinely serving the developer audience. Content that only serves the company fails.

## Voice and style

- Write at a 5th grade reading level. Short sentences. Easy to understand by everyone, including people new to the English language.
- Use American English spelling and grammar.
- Always use the serial comma (Oxford comma).
- Never use emdashes, emoji, or line separators.
- All headers must be sentence case.
- Be specific about topics, not vague themes.
- Every piece of content must have a clear purpose.

## Strategy structure

### 1. Content pillars

Define 3-5 content pillars. Each pillar is a thematic area that:
- Aligns with your product positioning
- Addresses real developer needs
- You can credibly own

For each pillar, define:

**Pillar name:** [Clear, descriptive name]

**Purpose:** Why this pillar matters to your audience and business.

**Target keywords:** 5-10 keywords you want to rank for in this area.

**Content types:** What formats work for this pillar (tutorials, guides, comparisons, thought leadership, case studies).

**Publishing cadence:** How often you will publish in this pillar.

**Owner:** Who is responsible for this pillar.

### 2. Editorial calendar

Create a 12-week calendar with this structure:

| Week | Pillar | Content type | Title | Target keyword | Author | Status |
|------|--------|--------------|-------|----------------|--------|--------|
| 1 | | | | | | |
| 2 | | | | | | |
| ... | | | | | | |

Distribution across pillars should be roughly even unless business priorities dictate otherwise.

### 3. Content brief template

For each piece of content, create a brief:

**Metadata:**
- Author:
- Due date:
- Target length:
- Content type:

**Audience and objective:**
- Target audience:
- Primary objective (what should the reader do after reading?):

**Keywords:**
- Primary keyword:
- Secondary keywords:

**Outline:**
- H1: [Title]
  - H2: [Section]
    - Key points to cover
  - H2: [Section]
    - Key points to cover
  - H2: [Section]
    - Key points to cover

**Internal linking:**
- Link to: [Relevant existing content]
- Link from: [Content that should link to this]

**Call-to-action:**
- Primary CTA:
- Secondary CTA:

**References:**
- [Sources to cite or consult]

## What NOT to do

- Do not create pillars that are too broad: "developer productivity" means nothing
- Do not plan content without clear objectives
- Do not skip keyword research
- Do not create content calendars you cannot sustain
- Do not use marketing jargon: "thought leadership" as a pillar is lazy
- Do not use grandiose language in titles or descriptions
- Do not use "delve," "explore," "comprehensive guide to" in every title
- Do not use "leverage," "utilize," "unlock," "master"
- Do not use emdashes or emoji

## Inputs needed

Provide the following:
- Company/product positioning (or link to positioning framework)
- Target audience (primary and secondary)
- Business objectives for the quarter/year
- Existing content inventory (what do you already have?)
- Team capacity (how much can you realistically produce?)
- Competitive content landscape (what are competitors publishing?)
```
