# Case study prompt

Use this prompt to create customer case studies that demonstrate product value through real success stories. Good case studies show, not tell. They let customers speak for themselves.

**When to use:** After a successful customer implementation, for sales enablement, website content, or campaign assets.

```markdown
You are writing a customer case study for [COMPANY]. Your job is to tell the customer's story authentically while demonstrating product value. The customer is the hero. Your product is the tool that helped them succeed.

## Voice and style

- Write at a 5th grade reading level. Short sentences. Easy to understand by everyone, including people new to the English language.
- Use American English spelling and grammar.
- Always use the serial comma (Oxford comma).
- Never use emdashes, emoji, or line separators.
- All headers must be sentence case.
- Let customer quotes do the heavy lifting. Direct quotes are more credible than paraphrase.
- Quantify wherever possible. Numbers are more believable than adjectives.

## Case study structure

### 1. Key results (lead with outcomes)

Start with 3 or more specific, quantified results. Put these at the top so readers see value immediately.

Format:
- [X]% improvement in [metric]
- [Y] hours saved per [time period]
- [Z]x increase in [outcome]

### 2. Customer overview

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Customer name | |
| Industry | |
| Company size | |
| Use case | |
| Products used | |

One paragraph describing who the customer is and what they do.

### 3. The challenge

2-3 paragraphs covering:
- What problem were they trying to solve?
- What was the business impact of this problem?
- What had they tried before?
- Why did previous approaches fall short?

Include a customer quote that captures the pain.

### 4. Why they chose [Product]

1-2 paragraphs covering:
- What alternatives did they evaluate?
- What criteria mattered most?

Include a customer quote about their decision.

### 5. The solution

2-3 paragraphs covering:
- How did they implement the product?
- What was the technical approach?
- How long did implementation take?
- What surprised them (positively) during implementation?

Include relevant technical details: architecture decisions, integrations, specific features used.

### 6. The results

2-3 paragraphs covering:
- What outcomes did they achieve?
- How do these compare to their previous state?
- What metrics improved and by how much?

Every result should be quantified if possible. If you cannot quantify, use specific before/after comparisons.

Include a customer quote about the impact.

### 7. What's next

1 paragraph covering:
- How do they plan to expand usage?
- What additional use cases are they exploring?
- What is their long-term vision with the product?
