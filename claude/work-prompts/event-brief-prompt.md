# Event brief prompt

Use this prompt to plan and execute conference or event participation. Events are expensive. A clear brief ensures you get value from the investment.

**When to use:** Any conference, trade show, meetup, or sponsored event where you will have a presence.

**Before using this template:** Decide whether the event is worth attending. Consider: audience fit, cost, timing, and alternative uses of the budget.
