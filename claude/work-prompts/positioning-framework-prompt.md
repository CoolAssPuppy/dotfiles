# Positioning framework prompt

Use this prompt to define how your product is positioned in the competitive landscape and why it appeals to developers. A strong positioning framework guides all downstream marketing: messaging, content, campaigns, and sales conversations.

**When to use:** New product launches, rebranding efforts, entering new markets, annual strategy refresh, or when messaging feels inconsistent across teams.

```markdown
You are creating a positioning framework for a developer tool or platform. Your output will guide all marketing and sales communications. Be specific, honest, and grounded in real differentiation.

## Voice and style

- Write at a 5th grade reading level. Short sentences. Easy to understand by everyone, including people new to the English language.
- Use American English spelling and grammar.
- Always use the serial comma (Oxford comma).
- Never use emdashes, emoji, or line separators.
- All headers must be sentence case.
- Be direct and specific. Avoid vague claims.
- Ground every statement in evidence or concrete capability.

## Framework structure

### 1. Category test
Test whether the positioning elements can stand alone:
- Does the category descriptor alone answer "what is this product?"
- Does the primary use case alone answer "what is this product?"
- If either test fails, revise the element until it passes before continuing.

### 2. Positioning statement
Complete this framework:
"For [target developers with specific context]
who [experience this specific problem],
[Product] is a [category descriptor]
that [primary benefit in developer terms].
Unlike [primary alternative],
we [key differentiator that matters to developers]."

### 3. Problem-framing variants
Rewrite the problem statement three ways:
- Category-anchored: Frame the problem as a gap in the category
- Use-case-anchored: Frame the problem as a daily workflow pain
- Alternative-anchored: Frame the problem as frustration with the current approach
Recommend which framing best fits the product's go-to-market motion.

### 4. Three messaging pillars (Aristotle's framework)

**Pillar 1 - Emotional Appeal (Pathos):**
- Value claim: Why will developers love using this?
- How it works: The mechanism or approach that enables this benefit
- Without this: What happens if the developer does not act
- Proof points: testimonials, community sentiment, adoption stories

**Pillar 2 - Logical Appeal (Logos):**
- Value claim: What unique technical capabilities does it have?
- How it works: The mechanism or approach that enables this benefit
- Without this: What happens if the developer does not act
- Proof points: benchmarks, performance data, feature comparisons

**Pillar 3 - Credibility Appeal (Ethos):**
- Value claim: Why can developers depend on this long-term?
- How it works: The mechanism or approach that enables this benefit
- Without this: What happens if the developer does not act
- Proof points: customer logos, uptime stats, team credentials

### 5. Differentiation summary
One sentence synthesizing all three pillars into a unified differentiation story.

### 6. Competitive positioning
For each competitor, provide:
- What they genuinely do well (be honest)
- Where you have defensible advantages
- The consequence for the customer of choosing them over you

### 7. Messaging guidelines

DO:
- Lead with technical capability, then business benefit
- Use precise technical terminology correctly
- Show working code examples in all materials
- Acknowledge limitations and tradeoffs honestly
- Let the product speak through demos and docs

DON'T:
- Use superlatives without proof ("blazing fast", "revolutionary")
- Lead with business value before technical substance
- Hide pricing or require sales calls for basic info
- Ignore competitor strengths in comparisons
- Create artificial urgency or scarcity
- Use vague differentiators: "better developer experience" or "more intuitive"
- Claim to be "the best" or "the leading" without proof
- Use marketing jargon: "synergy," "holistic," "end-to-end solution"
- Use grandiose language: "revolutionizing," "transforming the industry"
- Use "seamless," "robust," "cutting-edge," "powerful" without explaining why
- Use "leverage," "utilize," "facilitate," "delve"
- Use trailing participle clauses
- Use emdashes or emoji

### 8. Validation
Run four tests on the completed positioning:
- Duck test: Does it clearly name what the product is?
- Category test: Can the category alone classify the product?
- Swap test: Can a competitor say the same positioning statement truthfully?
- Consequence test: Does each pillar have a tangible cost of inaction?
Flag any failures and suggest revisions.
```

## Inputs needed

Provide the following:
- Product name and brief description
- Target audience (be specific: role, company size, technical context)
- 2-3 main competitors
- Key features and capabilities
- Any existing proof points (metrics, customers, certifications)
- Honest assessment of weaknesses or gaps

Apply the "Help First" principle: every piece of positioning should help customers understand if this product solves their problem, even if the answer is no.
