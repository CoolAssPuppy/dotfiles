# Positioning framework prompt

Use this prompt to define how your product is positioned in the competitive landscape and why it appeals to developers. A strong positioning framework guides all downstream marketing: messaging, content, campaigns, and sales conversations.

**When to use:** New product launches, rebranding efforts, entering new markets, annual strategy refresh, or when messaging feels inconsistent across teams.

```markdown
You are creating a positioning framework for a developer tool or platform. Your output will guide all marketing and sales communications. Be specific, honest, and grounded in real differentiation.

## Voice and style

- Write at a 5th grade reading level. Short sentences. Easy to understand by everyone, including people new to the English language.
- Use American English spelling and grammar.
- Always use the serial comma (Oxford comma).
- Never use emdashes, emoji, or line separators.
- All headers must be sentence case.
- Be direct and specific. Avoid vague claims.
- Ground every statement in evidence or concrete capability.

## Framework structure

### 1. Category statement

Complete this sentence:
"[PRODUCT] is a [CATEGORY] that helps [TARGET AUDIENCE] achieve [OUTCOME]."

Keep it simple. One sentence. No jargon.

### 2. Three pillars

Define your positioning across three dimensions:

**Emotional pillar:** How does this product improve developers' lives? What frustration does it eliminate? What does it feel like to use?

**Logical pillar:** What unique capabilities does it offer? What can developers do with this that they cannot do with alternatives? Be specific about features.

**Credibility pillar:** Why should developers trust this? Include: company track record, scale metrics, security certifications, notable customers, open source contributions, or technical pedigree.

### 3. Competitive differentiation

For each of 2-3 main competitors, provide:
- Competitor name
- Their positioning (how they describe themselves)
- Your advantage (specific, provable)
- When you would recommend them instead (be honest)

### 4. Proof points

List 3-5 concrete proof points that validate your positioning:
- Customer testimonials with names and companies
- Usage metrics (users, requests, uptime)
- Performance benchmarks
- Security certifications
- Industry recognition

Each proof point must be specific and verifiable.

## What NOT to do

- Do not use vague differentiators: "better developer experience" or "more intuitive"
- Do not claim to be "the best" or "the leading" without proof
- Do not use marketing jargon: "synergy," "holistic," "end-to-end solution"
- Do not use grandiose language: "revolutionizing," "transforming the industry"
- Do not ignore competitor strengths. Honest positioning builds trust.
- Do not use "seamless," "robust," "cutting-edge," "powerful" without explaining why
- Do not use "leverage," "utilize," "facilitate," "delve"
- Do not use trailing participle clauses
- Do not use emdashes or emoji

## Inputs needed

Provide the following:
- Product name and brief description
- Target audience (be specific: role, company size, technical context)
- 2-3 main competitors
- Key features and capabilities
- Any existing proof points (metrics, customers, certifications)
- Honest assessment of weaknesses or gaps
