# Competitive analysis prompt

Use this prompt to understand your competitive landscape and develop honest, effective positioning. Good competitive analysis acknowledges competitor strengths. Pretending competitors are bad makes you look uninformed.

**When to use:** Positioning work, sales enablement, product strategy, annual planning, or when a new competitor emerges.

```markdown
You are creating a competitive analysis for a developer tool or platform. Your analysis must be honest, specific, and actionable. Biased analysis misleads your own team.

## Voice and style

- Write at a 5th grade reading level. Short sentences. Easy to understand by everyone, including people new to the English language.
- Use American English spelling and grammar.
- Always use the serial comma (Oxford comma).
- Never use emdashes, emoji, or line separators.
- All headers must be sentence case.
- Be honest about competitor strengths. Your credibility depends on it.
- Back every claim with evidence.

## Analysis structure

### 1. Competitor overview

For each competitor (analyze 2-5):

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Name | |
| Category | |
| Primary ICP | |
| Positioning statement | [How they describe themselves] |
| Pricing model | |
| Estimated market position | |

### 2. Product comparison

Create a feature comparison matrix:

| Capability | Your product | Competitor A | Competitor B | Competitor C |
|------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| [Feature 1] | | | | |
| [Feature 2] | | | | |
| [Feature 3] | | | | |

Use clear ratings: Yes / No / Partial / Superior / Inferior

### 3. Strengths and weaknesses

For each competitor:

**[Competitor name]**

Strengths (be honest):
- [Strength]: [Evidence]
- [Strength]: [Evidence]

Weaknesses:
- [Weakness]: [Evidence]
- [Weakness]: [Evidence]

### 4. Your advantages

For each advantage you have:

| Advantage | Evidence | Messaging approach |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| | | |

### 5. Their advantages

For each advantage they have:

| Their advantage | Why it matters | Counter or neutralization strategy |
|-----------------|----------------|-----------------------------------|
| | | |

Be honest. If you cannot counter an advantage, acknowledge it. There are deals you should not win.

### 6. Consequences of each choice

For each competitive alternative (direct competitors, status quo, build-it-yourself), articulate the specific, measurable consequences the customer faces if they choose that path instead of your product.

| Alternative | Consequence | Impact |
|-------------|-------------|--------|
| [Competitor 1] | [Specific consequence] | [Measurable impact] |
| [Status quo] | [Specific consequence] | [Measurable impact] |
| [Build-it-yourself] | [Specific consequence] | [Measurable impact] |

Be honest. Do not exaggerate. The consequences should be specific enough that a customer would recognize them from their own experience.

### 7. Competitive talking points

For common competitive situations, provide response frameworks:

**When prospect asks about [Competitor]:**
- Acknowledge: [What you can honestly say is good about them]
- Differentiate: [Your specific advantage in this context]
- Prove: [Evidence that supports your differentiation]

**When prospect is evaluating [Competitor] for [use case]:**
- If they need [X], we are stronger because [specific reason]
- If they need [Y], [Competitor] may be a better fit because [honest assessment]

### 8. When to recommend competitors

List scenarios where you would recommend a competitor:

| Scenario | Recommended alternative | Why |
|----------|------------------------|-----|
| | | |

This builds trust with prospects and saves everyone time on bad-fit deals.

### 9. Migration paths

If relevant, document how customers migrate from each competitor:

**Migrating from [Competitor]:**
- Technical steps:
- Common challenges:
- Typical timeline:
- Resources available:
