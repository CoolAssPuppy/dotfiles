# Blog Research and Creation System

## Phase 1: Market Research and Analysis

Analyze the most recent content from these categories:

1. **Developer Marketing**
   - DevRel blogs (DevRel Weekly, DevRel.co)
   - Developer-focused content platforms (Dev.to, Hashnode, Medium engineering tags)
   - Technical marketing blogs (Segment, Twilio, Stripe, Vercel)
   - Developer tool company blogs

2. **Product Marketing**
   - Product Hunt discussions
   - ProductLed blog
   - OpenView Partners content
   - First Round Review
   - Reforge articles

3. **Technical Marketing**
   - HackerNews top discussions
   - Reddit (r/programming, r/webdev, r/startups)
   - Technical podcasts (Changelog, Software Engineering Daily)
   - YouTube (Fireship, Traversy Media, tech conference talks)
   - Technical tutorials and documentation trends

### Analysis Framework

#### 1. Theme Identification
- Identify top 10-15 recurring themes
- Map pain points and frustrations
- Document areas of confusion
- Note controversial or debated topics
- Track emerging trends and technologies

#### 2. Problem Pattern Analysis
Look for:
- **Knowledge gaps**: What are people struggling to understand?
- **Tool fatigue**: What tools/processes are causing frustration?
- **Decision paralysis**: Where are people stuck choosing between options?
- **Implementation challenges**: What's hard to actually do in practice?
- **Cost concerns**: What's expensive or resource-intensive?
- **Time sinks**: What's taking too long?
- **Technical debt**: What shortcuts are causing long-term problems?

#### 3. Sentiment Analysis
- What makes developers angry or frustrated?
- What excites or energizes the community?
- What are the "hot takes" getting engagement?
- What sacred cows need challenging?

## Phase 2: Picks and Shovels Framework Application

### Core Principles from Picks and Shovels
1. **Sell to the sellers** - Target those building/selling, not end users
2. **Infrastructure over features** - Focus on foundational tools
3. **Recurring problems** - Address persistent, not one-time issues
4. **Multiplicative value** - Solutions that scale with customer growth
5. **Technical moats** - Deep technical content others can't easily replicate

### Content Opportunity Scoring
Rate each potential topic (1-10) on:
- **Problem severity**: How painful is this problem?
- **Audience size**: How many people face this?
- **Solution complexity**: Can you provide unique insights?
- **Competitive gap**: Is quality content missing?
- **Business relevance**: Does this drive revenue/growth?
- **Evergreen potential**: Will this stay relevant?

## Phase 3: Top 10 Blog Post Proposals

For each proposed post, provide:

### Structure for Each Proposal
```

Remember: We're not just writing content, we're solving real problems for real developers. Every post should leave the reader smarter and more capable than before.

2. The target audience (e.g., "technical founders", "developer advocates", "product managers")
