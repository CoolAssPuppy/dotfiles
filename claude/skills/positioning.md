# Developer product positioning framework

You are an expert in developer marketing positioning. Use this skill to create comprehensive positioning frameworks for developer products using Aristotle's rhetorical principles (pathos, logos, ethos).

## When to use this skill

Use this skill when:
- Launching a new developer product or feature
- Repositioning an existing product in the market
- Entering a new market segment
- Differentiating from new competitors
- Creating foundational marketing materials

## The prompt

Copy and customize this prompt to generate a positioning framework for your product:

```markdown
Create a comprehensive positioning framework for [PRODUCT NAME], a developer product.

PRODUCT CONTEXT:
- What it does: [DESCRIBE THE CORE FUNCTIONALITY]
- Target developers: [ROLE, SENIORITY, TECH STACK]
- Primary competitors: [LIST 2-4 WITH BRIEF DESCRIPTIONS]
- Current traction: [USERS, CUSTOMERS, OR STAGE]

DELIVER THE FOLLOWING:

1. DEVELOPER PERSONA
Define the specific developer who gets the most value:
- Primary role and seniority level
- Technical stack and daily workflows
- The specific pain points they experience today
- What motivates them to evaluate new tools
- Where they discover and evaluate solutions (communities, content, peers)

2. VALUE PROPOSITION
Create a single sentence that:
- Explains the technical capability (what it does)
- States the developer benefit (why it matters)
- Uses language a developer would use in a GitHub README
- Avoids marketing buzzwords entirely

3. THREE MESSAGING PILLARS (Aristotle's Framework)
Structure your pillars around these rhetorical elements:

Pillar 1 - Emotional Appeal (Pathos):
- Why will developers love using this?
- What productivity gains or pain relief does it provide?
- How does it make their daily work better?
- Proof points: testimonials, community sentiment, adoption stories

Pillar 2 - Logical Appeal (Logos):
- What unique technical capabilities does it have?
- What are the measurable differentiators?
- Benchmarks, performance data, feature comparisons
- Proof points: technical documentation, benchmarks, architecture

Pillar 3 - Credibility Appeal (Ethos):
- Why can developers depend on this long-term?
- What track record, team background, or backing proves reliability?
- Security certifications, enterprise adoption, funding, open source health
- Proof points: customer logos, uptime stats, team credentials

4. POSITIONING STATEMENT
Complete this framework with specifics:
"For [target developers with specific context]
who [experience this specific problem],
[Product] is a [category descriptor]
that [primary benefit in developer terms].
Unlike [primary alternative],
we [key differentiator that matters to developers]."

5. COMPETITIVE POSITIONING
For each competitor, provide:
- What they genuinely do well (be honest - it builds credibility)
- Where you have defensible advantages
- The specific use cases where you win
- When you should actually recommend them instead (yes, really)
- How to handle objections when they come up in evaluation

6. MESSAGING GUIDELINES

DO:
- Lead with technical capability, then business benefit
- Use precise technical terminology correctly
- Show working code examples in all materials
- Acknowledge limitations and tradeoffs honestly
- Let the product speak through demos and docs

DON'T:
- Use superlatives without proof ("blazing fast", "revolutionary")
- Lead with business value before technical substance
- Hide pricing or require sales calls for basic info
- Ignore competitor strengths in comparisons
- Create artificial urgency or scarcity

Apply the "Help First" principle: every piece of positioning should help developers understand if this product solves their problem, even if the answer is no.
```

## Example output

A well-executed positioning framework will include:
- A clearly defined developer persona with specific technical context
- A jargon-free value proposition that could appear in a README
- Three messaging pillars with concrete proof points
- A positioning statement that differentiates from alternatives
- Honest competitive analysis that builds trust
- Clear messaging guidelines for the team
