# Product positioning and messaging

This skill helps create positioning and messaging frameworks for technical products based on the methodology from "Picks and Shovels."

## Core principle

Positioning is about owning a specific place in your customer's mind. For technical products, this means being the obvious choice for a specific type of buyer solving a specific problem.

---

## Workflow

Follow these steps in order:

1. Define market segmentation
2. Create ideal customer profile (ICP)
3. Develop positioning statement
4. Build messaging hierarchy
5. Create value propositions

---

## Step 1: Market segmentation

Segment your market using these dimensions:

**By role:**
- Individual contributors (hobbyists, side projects)
- Startup teams (early-stage, resource-constrained)
- Enterprise teams (compliance, scale, support needs)
- Platform teams (infrastructure, operations)

**By technology stack:**
- Language preferences
- Framework preferences
- Infrastructure preferences (cloud-native, on-prem, hybrid)

**By use case:**
- Building new applications
- Migrating existing systems
- Scaling infrastructure
- Reducing costs

**By buying behavior:**
- Self-serve (credit card purchases)
- Procurement-driven (enterprise sales)
- Open-source-first (community adoption)

### Output format

```markdown
## Market segmentation

### Primary segment
- Role: [specific role]
- Technology: [stack preferences]
- Use case: [primary problem they solve]
- Buying: [how they purchase]

### Secondary segment
[Same structure]
```

---

## Step 2: Ideal customer profile (ICP)

Create a detailed ICP using this framework:

**Demographics:**
- Company size (employees, team size)
- Industry vertical
- Geographic focus
- Funding stage (if startup)

**Technographics:**
- Current tools and infrastructure
- Technical maturity level
- Build vs. buy philosophy

**Behaviors:**
- Where they learn (blogs, YouTube, conferences)
- How they evaluate tools (POCs, benchmarks, peer reviews)
- Who influences decisions (individual, team, management)

**Pain points:**
- Primary technical challenges
- Business pressures they face
- What keeps them from solving problems today

### Output format

```markdown
## Ideal customer profile

### Demographics
- Company size: [range]
- Industry: [verticals]
- Funding/revenue: [stage or range]

### Technographics
- Stack: [technologies they use]
- Maturity: [early/mid/late adopters]
- Philosophy: [build vs. buy preference]

### Behaviors
- Learning: [channels they use]
- Evaluation: [how they choose tools]
- Influencers: [who affects decisions]

### Pain points
1. [Primary pain point with context]
2. [Secondary pain point]
3. [Tertiary pain point]
```

---

## Step 3: Positioning statement

Use this template:

```
For [target customer]
who [has this problem/need],
[Product name] is a [category]
that [key benefit].
Unlike [primary alternative],
we [key differentiator].
```

**Guidelines:**
- Target customer must match your ICP
- Problem must be specific and urgent
- Category should be recognizable (or define a new one strategically)
- Key benefit must be measurable or demonstrable
- Differentiator must be defensible and meaningful

### Positioning types

Choose your positioning approach:

1. **Category leader**: Own an existing category ("the best Postgres database")
2. **Category creator**: Define a new category ("real-time analytics for developers")
3. **Challenger**: Position against the incumbent ("Firebase alternative")
4. **Niche specialist**: Own a specific use case ("time-series data at scale")

---

## Step 4: Messaging hierarchy

Build a three-level messaging hierarchy using Aristotle's rhetorical framework:

**Level 1: Headline (5-10 words)**
- The single most important thing you want customers to remember
- Should pass the "billboard test" (understood in 3 seconds)

**Level 2: Value pillars (3 pillars using Aristotle's framework)**

Pillar 1 - Emotional Appeal (Pathos):
- Why will users love using this?
- What productivity gains or pain relief does it provide?
- How does it make their daily work better?
- Proof points: testimonials, community sentiment, adoption stories

Pillar 2 - Logical Appeal (Logos):
- What unique technical capabilities does it have?
- What are the measurable differentiators?
- Benchmarks, performance data, feature comparisons
- Proof points: technical documentation, benchmarks, architecture

Pillar 3 - Credibility Appeal (Ethos):
- Why can customers depend on this long-term?
- What track record, team background, or backing proves reliability?
- Security certifications, enterprise adoption, funding, open source health
- Proof points: customer logos, uptime stats, team credentials

**Level 3: Proof points (2-3 per pillar)**
- Specific features, metrics, or customer outcomes
- Evidence that backs up each value pillar

### Output format

```markdown
## Messaging hierarchy

### Headline
[5-10 word statement]

### Value pillars

#### Pillar 1: Emotional Appeal (Pathos)
[One sentence description]

Proof points:
- [Specific feature or metric]
- [Customer outcome or benchmark]

#### Pillar 2: Logical Appeal (Logos)
[One sentence description]

Proof points:
- [Specific feature or metric]
- [Customer outcome or benchmark]

#### Pillar 3: Credibility Appeal (Ethos)
[One sentence description]

Proof points:
- [Specific feature or metric]
- [Customer outcome or benchmark]
```

## Step 5: Value propositions

Create value propositions for different audiences and contexts:

**For technical evaluators:**
- Focus on capabilities, performance, user experience
- Use technical language and specifics
- Include code examples or architecture diagrams

**For technical decision makers:**
- Balance technical depth with business value
- Address scalability, reliability, support
- Include total cost of ownership considerations

**For business stakeholders:**
- Focus on outcomes and ROI
- Address risk, vendor stability, compliance
- Use business language, not technical jargon

### Value proposition template

```markdown
## Value proposition: [Audience]

### Hook
[One sentence that captures attention]

### Problem
[The specific challenge this audience faces]

### Solution
[How your product addresses this]

### Proof
[Evidence: metrics, customers, benchmarks]

### Call to action
[What you want them to do next]
```

---

## Competitive positioning

For each competitor, provide:
- What they genuinely do well (be honest - it builds credibility)
- Where you have defensible advantages
- The specific use cases where you win
- When you should actually recommend them instead (yes, really)
- How to handle objections when they come up in evaluation

---

## Messaging guidelines

**DO:**
- Lead with technical capability, then business benefit
- Use precise technical terminology correctly
- Show working code examples in all materials
- Acknowledge limitations and tradeoffs honestly
- Let the product speak through demos and docs

**DON'T:**
- Use superlatives without proof ("blazing fast", "revolutionary")
- Lead with business value before technical substance
- Hide pricing or require sales calls for basic info
- Ignore competitor strengths in comparisons
- Create artificial urgency or scarcity

Apply the "Help First" principle: every piece of positioning should help customers understand if this product solves their problem, even if the answer is no.

---

## Validation checklist

Before finalizing positioning:

- [ ] Can a customer understand it in under 10 seconds?
- [ ] Does it clearly identify who it's for?
- [ ] Does it articulate a specific problem?
- [ ] Is the differentiation meaningful and defensible?
- [ ] Can you prove your claims with evidence?
- [ ] Does it resonate with your ICP's pain points?
- [ ] Is it different from your top 3 competitors?

---

## Common mistakes to avoid

1. **Being too broad**: "For everyone" is not a positioning
2. **Feature-first messaging**: Lead with benefits, not features
3. **Copying competitors**: Differentiate or lose
4. **Ignoring the status quo**: Your biggest competitor is often "do nothing"
5. **Jargon overload**: Clarity beats cleverness
6. **Inconsistent messaging**: Same core story across all channels
