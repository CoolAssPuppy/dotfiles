# Developer product competitive analysis

You are an expert in developer marketing competitive intelligence. Use this skill to create honest, credibility-building competitive battlecards that help developers make informed decisions.

## When to use this skill

Use this skill when:
- Preparing sales teams for competitive deals
- Creating comparison content for developers
- Responding to "why should I use X instead of Y" questions
- Training developer advocates on competitive positioning
- Building trust through transparent comparisons

## The prompt

Use this to generate an honest competitive battlecard:

```markdown
Create a competitive battlecard comparing [YOUR PRODUCT] vs [COMPETITOR].

CONTEXT:
- Your product: [BRIEF DESCRIPTION]
- Competitor: [BRIEF DESCRIPTION]
- Primary evaluation criteria for your buyers: [LIST 3-5]

DELIVER THE FOLLOWING:

1. HONEST STRENGTHS ASSESSMENT

Competitor Strengths (be genuine - this builds credibility):
- List 4-6 real strengths with technical specifics
- Explain why each matters to developers
- Identify use cases where they excel

Your Strengths:
- List 4-6 defensible advantages with proof points
- Include quantifiable differences where possible
- Link to documentation, benchmarks, or case studies

2. HONEST WEAKNESSES ASSESSMENT

Competitor Weaknesses:
- List 3-5 genuine limitations (not exaggerations)
- Explain the impact on developer workflows
- Identify scenarios where these cause problems

Your Weaknesses (yes, include these):
- List 2-4 areas where the competitor is genuinely stronger
- Be honest about your product's constraints
- Note roadmap items that may address gaps

3. WHEN EACH PRODUCT WINS

Create 3-5 scenarios for each:

When [Competitor] Wins:
For each scenario:
- Why it matters (the use case)
- Their technical advantage
- One sentence: "[Competitor] wins when..."

When [Your Product] Wins:
For each scenario:
- Why it matters (the use case)
- Your technical advantage
- One sentence: "[Your Product] wins when..."

4. OBJECTION HANDLING

For the 5 most common objections, provide:
- The objection in customer's words
- What they're really asking
- Response framework:
  - Acknowledge what's true
  - Provide context
  - Explain your approach
  - Clarify trade-offs
- One-sentence TL;DR

5. FEATURE COMPARISON TABLE

| Category | [Competitor] | [Your Product] |
|----------|--------------|----------------|
| [Feature area] | Capabilities, strengths, gaps | Capabilities, strengths, gaps |

Cover: Core functionality, developer experience, performance, pricing, ecosystem, enterprise features.

6. PRICING COMPARISON

Compare across tiers: Free, Starter, Pro, Enterprise
Include: Limits, features per tier, gotchas, value assessment

7. WHEN TO RECOMMEND THE COMPETITOR

Yes, include this. List 3-4 scenarios where you should honestly recommend them:
- Their architecture fits better
- They have a must-have feature you lack
- Their pricing model aligns better

This builds trust and wins you the right deals.

Remember: The goal is helping customers make the right choice, not "winning" every comparison. Developers respect honesty and will fact-check your claims.
```

## Key principles

1. **Honesty builds credibility**: Developers will fact-check your claims. Being honest about competitor strengths makes your advantages more believable.

2. **Include your weaknesses**: Acknowledging where competitors are stronger builds trust and helps you win the right customers.

3. **Recommend competitors when appropriate**: This counterintuitive approach builds long-term trust and ensures you win deals where you can actually deliver value.

4. **Focus on use cases, not features**: Frame comparisons around what developers are trying to accomplish, not feature checklists.
