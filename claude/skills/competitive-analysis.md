# Competitive analysis

This skill helps conduct competitive analysis and create battle cards for technical products based on the methodology from "Picks and Shovels."

## Core principle

Competitive analysis is not about reacting. It is about proactively positioning your product to win in the minds of customers and decision makers. Honesty builds credibility; customers will fact-check your claims.

---

## Competitor identification

Look beyond the obvious. Map all four types of competition:

### Direct competitors

Companies offering similar products targeting the same audience.

**How to analyze:**
- Deep technical teardown
- Understand architecture choices
- Identify design philosophy
- Map feature parity

**Example:** Two Postgres-based databases competing for the same users

### Indirect competitors

Companies solving similar problems through different approaches.

**How to analyze:**
- Understand their mental model
- Map overlapping use cases
- Identify where they excel
- Find positioning gaps

**Example:** Monday (opinionated team tool) vs Airtable (flexible database)

### The status quo

The biggest competitor is often "do nothing." If it works and it's paid for, why change?

**How to analyze:**
- Understand switching costs
- Identify pain thresholds
- Find "hair on fire" moments
- Map organizational inertia
- Articulate the specific, measurable consequence of inaction for each stakeholder

**Key insight:** To break through inertia, you must solve the top problem a stakeholder with spending authority cares about.

### Build-it-yourself teams

Some customers love building things. Your product may compete with internal solutions.

**How to analyze:**
- Understand build vs buy philosophy
- Calculate true cost of DIY
- Identify maintenance burden
- Find complexity thresholds

**Question to ask:** If your product can be quickly built in-house, should you rethink the product?

## Product and feature comparison

Conduct an honest teardown:

### Feature comparison

Go beyond marketing feature lists:

- Note where they excel
- Identify your advantages
- Be honest about gaps

### User experience evaluation

- Onboarding friction

## Customer intelligence

The best competitive intelligence comes from customers:

### Win/loss interviews

Interview customers who:
- Chose you over competitors
- Chose competitors over you
- Evaluated both and chose neither

**Questions to explore:**
- How did you find each option?
- What were the evaluation criteria?
- What tipped the decision?
- What surprised you during evaluation?

### Discovery questions for sales

Add to sales calls:
- "What other solutions have you considered?"
- "How are you solving this problem today?"
- "What would make you switch?"
- "Who else is involved in this decision?"

### Customer surveys

Include competitive questions:
- "Did you consider alternatives before choosing us?"
- "What almost made you choose something else?"
- "How do you compare us to [competitor]?"

## Battle card structure

Create battle cards that sales will actually use:

### First rule of sales collateral

Nobody reads long documents. Structure for scanning.

### Battle card template

```markdown
# [Competitor Name] Battle Card

## Quick summary (top of document)

### Their positioning
[One sentence: how they see themselves]

### Our positioning vs. them
[One sentence: why we win]

### Key differentiators

**Why we win:**
- [Differentiator 1]
- [Differentiator 2]
- [Differentiator 3]

**Why we lose:**
- [Scenario 1]
- [Scenario 2]

## Honest strengths assessment

### Competitor strengths (be genuine - this builds credibility)
- [Strength 1 with technical specifics]
- [Strength 2 with why it matters]
- [Strength 3 with use cases where they excel]

### Your strengths
- [Advantage 1 with proof points]
- [Advantage 2 with quantifiable differences]
- [Advantage 3 with documentation/benchmarks]

## Honest weaknesses assessment

### Competitor weaknesses
- [Limitation 1 - genuine, not exaggerated]
- [Limitation 2 - impact on workflows]
- [Limitation 3 - scenarios where it causes problems]

### Your weaknesses (yes, include these)
- [Area where competitor is genuinely stronger]
- [Your product's constraints]
- [Roadmap items that may address gaps]

## When each product wins

### When [Competitor] wins
- Scenario: [Use case] / Their advantage: [Technical reason]
- Scenario: [Use case] / Their advantage: [Technical reason]

### When [Your Product] wins
- Scenario: [Use case] / Your advantage: [Technical reason]
- Scenario: [Use case] / Your advantage: [Technical reason]

## Consequences of each choice

### If customer stays with [Competitor]
- [Specific consequence with measurable impact]
- [Specific consequence with measurable impact]

### If customer stays with status quo
- [Specific consequence with measurable impact]
- [Specific consequence with measurable impact]

### If customer builds it themselves
- [Specific consequence with measurable impact]
- [Specific consequence with measurable impact]

## Qualification questions

Ask these to determine fit:

1. [Question that favors you if answered X way]
2. [Question that favors you if answered Y way]
3. [Question that reveals their priorities]

## Handling objections

### "They have [feature] and you don't"
- What they're really asking: [Context]
- Response: Acknowledge, provide context, explain approach, clarify trade-offs
- TL;DR: [One sentence]

### "They're cheaper"
[Response with value framing]

### "They're more established"
[Response with agility/innovation angle]

## Feature comparison table

| Category | [Competitor] | [Your Product] |
|----------|--------------|----------------|
| Core functionality | Capabilities | Capabilities |
| User experience | Strengths/gaps | Strengths/gaps |
| Performance | Benchmarks | Benchmarks |
| Pricing | Model/limits | Model/limits |
| Ecosystem | Integrations | Integrations |
| Enterprise | Features | Features |

## Pricing comparison

Compare across tiers: Free, Starter, Pro, Enterprise
Include: Limits, features per tier, gotchas, value assessment

## When to recommend the competitor

Yes, include this. List scenarios where you should honestly recommend them:
- Their architecture fits better
- They have a must-have feature you lack
- Their pricing model aligns better

This builds trust and wins you the right deals.

## Value differentiators

Beyond features, how to frame the evaluation:

1. [Value frame 1]: [Why this matters]
2. [Value frame 2]: [Why this matters]
3. [Value frame 3]: [Why this matters]

## Deep dive

[Detailed analysis, screenshots, technical comparisons]
[Most people won't read this, but it shows your work]
```

## Competitive positioning strategies

Choose your approach:

### Head-to-head

Directly compete on the same criteria.
- Best when you genuinely win on key dimensions
- Requires strong proof points
- Risk: legitimizes competitor

### Reframe the criteria

Change what matters in the evaluation.
- Best when you're different, not just better
- Requires thought leadership to shift perspective
- Example: "Speed doesn't matter if you can't scale"

### Niche down

Own a specific segment or use case.
- Best when you can't win broadly
- Becomes the obvious choice for that niche
- Example: "The database for time-series data"

### Category creation

Define a new category you lead.
- Best when genuinely novel
- Requires significant investment
- Risk: market education burden

## Key principles

1. **Honesty builds credibility**: Customers will fact-check your claims. Being honest about competitor strengths makes your advantages more believable.

2. **Include your weaknesses**: Acknowledging where competitors are stronger builds trust and helps you win the right customers.

3. **Recommend competitors when appropriate**: This counterintuitive approach builds long-term trust and ensures you win deals where you can actually deliver value.

4. **Focus on use cases, not features**: Frame comparisons around what customers are trying to accomplish, not feature checklists.
