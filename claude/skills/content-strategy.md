# Content strategy

This skill helps create content marketing strategies for technical products based on the methodology from "Picks and Shovels."

## Core principle: Help First

Content marketing for technical audiences starts from a place of genuine helpfulness. Technical buyers hate overt marketing but love learning. If you build a reputation for producing excellent technical content, they will seek you out.

> Help First means leading with value, not with a sales pitch.

---

## Inside-out vs outside-in content

Understanding this distinction is crucial:

### Inside-out content

Content about you and your products:
- Launch posts and announcements
- Changelogs and release notes
- Product tutorials
- Documentation
- Feature deep dives

**Audience:** Existing users and active evaluators
**Purpose:** Conversion and retention
**Reach:** Narrow (people already interested)

### Outside-in content

Content that addresses audience interests broadly:
- Industry trends and analysis
- Problem-solving guides (not product-specific)
- Technology comparisons
- Best practices and patterns
- Historical context on technical topics

**Audience:** Broad community
**Purpose:** Awareness and trust-building
**Reach:** Wide (anyone interested in the topic)

### Balance recommendation

For content marketing focused on growth:
- 70% outside-in content (attract new audience)
- 30% inside-out content (convert interested prospects)

## Content and the buyer funnel

Different content serves different stages:

### Upper funnel (awareness)

Buyers conducting broad research. Low purchase intent.

**Content types:**
- Thought leadership posts
- Industry analysis
- Trend explainers
- Foundational tutorials
- Conference talks

**Goal:** Earn attention and credibility

### Middle funnel (consideration)

Buyers with a specific problem researching solutions.

**Content types:**
- Problem/solution posts
- Comparison guides
- Architecture patterns
- Case studies
- Benchmarks

**Goal:** Position your product as a solution

### Lower funnel (decision)

Buyers ready to evaluate and choose.

**Content types:**
- Product tutorials
- Getting started guides
- Documentation
- Demo videos
- Integration guides

**Goal:** Remove friction to adoption

## Content types that work

### 1. Getting started guides
First experience with your product. Critical for activation.

### 2. Tutorials

### 4. API documentation
For technical products, often the most visited content.

### 5. Case studies
Real companies, real problems, real solutions.

**Two types:**

### 6. Technical blog posts
Deep dives demonstrating expertise.

**Best practices:**
- Write for readers, not search engines

For each week, track:

## Content quality checklist

Before publishing:

- [ ] Does it help readers solve a real problem?
- [ ] Is the technical content accurate?
- [ ] Are code examples tested and working?
- [ ] Is the perspective unique or valuable?
- [ ] Does it respect the reader's time?
- [ ] Is the CTA relevant and non-intrusive?
- [ ] Has it been reviewed by a technical expert?
- [ ] Is it internally linked to related content?
- [ ] Is it optimized for search without being spammy?

## Common content mistakes

1. **Leading with product:** Start with the problem, not your solution
2. **Thin content:** No unique value or insight
3. **Outdated examples:** Code that no longer works
4. **Keyword stuffing:** Obvious SEO manipulation
5. **Ignoring existing content:** Not updating or repurposing
6. **No distribution plan:** Great content nobody sees
7. **Inconsistent publishing:** Sporadic posts undermine trust
8. **Wrong voice:** Too corporate, too casual, or inconsistent

Apply the "Help First" principle throughout: every piece should solve a real problem, even if the reader never becomes a customer.
