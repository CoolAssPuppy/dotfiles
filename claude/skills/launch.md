# Product launches

This skill helps plan and execute product launches for technical products based on the methodology from "Picks and Shovels."

## Core principle

A launch is not a moment; it's a campaign. The goal is sustained visibility and adoption, not a single spike of attention. The best launches feel less like "launches" and more like "this is now available." Focus on helping customers, not creating hype.

---

## Launch tiers

Not every launch deserves the same investment. Categorize launches into tiers:

### Tier 1: Major launches

- New products or platforms
- Major version releases (v2.0, v3.0)
- Pivotal new capabilities
- Company milestones (funding, major partnerships)

**Investment:** Full marketing campaign, press, events, executive involvement, 8+ weeks preparation

### Tier 2: Significant launches

- Important new features
- Meaningful integrations
- Performance improvements with measurable impact
- New pricing or packaging

**Investment:** Blog post, social campaign, email to customers, community engagement, 4-6 weeks preparation

### Tier 3: Incremental launches

- Minor features and improvements
- Bug fixes and optimizations
- Documentation updates
- Small quality-of-life improvements

**Investment:** Changelog entry, brief social mention, community update, 1-2 weeks preparation

## The sine wave pattern

Launches should follow a sine wave pattern of attention:

```
Attention
    ^
    |    /\      /\      /\
    |   /  \    /  \    /  \
    |  /    \  /    \  /    \
    | /      \/      \/      \
    +-------------------------> Time
      Pre    Launch   Post
```

**Pre-launch:** Build anticipation gradually
**Launch:** Peak attention
**Post-launch:** Sustain momentum through follow-up content

### Timing considerations

- **Avoid Mondays:** People are catching up from the weekend
- **Avoid Fridays:** Launches get lost before the weekend
- **Best days:** Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday
- **Best times:** 9-11 AM in your primary market's timezone
- **Avoid holidays:** Check all major markets for conflicts

## Product naming

Names matter. Follow these guidelines:

### Naming principles

1. **Easy to spell and pronounce**: Users will type it and say it
2. **Searchable**: Can people find you on Google?
3. **Memorable**: Does it stick after one mention?
4. **Extendable**: Can you build a product family around it?
5. **Available**: Domain, social handles, package names

### Naming patterns that work

- **Descriptive**: Clearly states what it does (CloudFlare, PostgreSQL)
- **Abstract but evocative**: Suggests the benefit (Stripe, Slack)
- **Portmanteau**: Combination words (Instagram, Pinterest)
- **Modified spelling**: Unique but recognizable (Lyft, Flickr)

### Naming anti-patterns

- Generic words that are unsearchable
- Names that sound like competitors
- Hard to spell or pronounce
- Offensive meanings in other languages
- Already trademarked in your industry

## Common launch mistakes

1. **Launching on Friday**: Momentum dies over the weekend
2. **No follow-up content**: One-and-done approach wastes initial attention
3. **Ignoring time zones**: Launch when your audience is awake
4. **Underselling Tier 1 launches**: Major launches deserve major investment
5. **Overselling Tier 3 launches**: Feature fatigue kills trust
6. **Not briefing internal teams**: Sales and support need to know first
7. **No rollback plan**: Be ready for technical issues
8. **Forgetting existing customers**: They should hear about it first
